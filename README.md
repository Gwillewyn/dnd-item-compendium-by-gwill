# D&D 5e Item Compendium

Three item compendiums: 
- Mundane Items  
- Magic Items   
- Treasure  
All with original and individual icons by Gwillewyn and neatly organised in subfolders.
880+ coloured vector images of items from D&D5e.
Vector images are small in file size and *infinitely* scalable.  The same picture can be used at 25x25px and 2500x2500px with no loss of quality.

## Examples

### Potion of Longevity

*Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating.*

## Content of the Compendiums

- Items from the SRD with full description (mostly copied from the in-game compendium)
- Items from the DMG and PHB *outside* the SRD have price and weight information, but no description or details (I will see about updating these when I find out exactly what the new OGL allows me to do)
- Spell components will have information about what spell they are needed for

## Content of the Artwork Folders

- Most mundane items from Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG) and Player Handbook (PHB)
    - Adventuring Gear
    - Ammunition
    - Armour
    - Food and Drink
    - Gaming Sets
    - Instruments
    - Mounts
    - Spellcasting foci
    - Tools, Kits, and Artisan Tools
    - Trade Good
    - Vehicles
    - Weapons
- Some Treasure items from DMG and PHB. (Some oddly specific ones have been made more generic.  Some I just didn't feel like making.)
- *All* Magic Potions from DMG
- Various Magic Items
- Spell components from PHB, Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, and Xanathar's Guide to Everything. *Nowhere near* everything, but I've tried to make those things that are very specific, hard to find, has a gold value, and any items that get consumed. Basically anything the DM might argue about whether or not you have. 
- And anything I just felt like making.

Certain items that I find it unreasonable to literally carry around with you, such as livestock and vehicles, are represented by a deed or receipt to keep in your inventory.
Some items come in more than one design for a bit of variety.

## Additional items include:

- A multitude of generic bottles and vials with various coloured content
- Unspecific generic gemstones of a variety of colours
- Generic Scrolls and Books
- Items referred to in starting equipment and toolkits that have no specified individual weight or value listed
- Items of (to me) unknown origin that my party has been awarded by out GM in various campaigns
- Things I just felt like making

Artwork is sorted by type in human-readable subfolders.

## Examples of Modifications

Most of these icons are colourised versions of items from [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/), some are slightly edited, some are heavily edited, and a few are originals by me trying to harmonise with the aesthetics of other icons.
